<h1>Wine Classification Project: Identifying Winemakers</h1>

This project focuses on a dataset obtained from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine/wine.data), which contains the results of a chemical analysis of wines produced by three winemakers in the same region of Italy. The dataset includes 13 measurements that represent the chemical properties of the wines, and the goal is to develop a classification model capable of determining the winemaker based on these characteristics.

<h2>Dataset Overview</h2>

The dataset features the following attributes:  
- **Alcohol**  
- **Malic Acid**: A key grape acid, influencing wine taste. Excess causes sourness, while too little results in flatness.  
- **Ash**  
- **Alcalinity of Ash**  
- **Magnesium**  
- **Total Phenols**  
- **Flavanoids**  
- **Nonflavanoid Phenols**  
- **Proanthocyanins**  
- **Color Intensity**  
- **Hue**  
- **OD280/OD315 of Diluted Wines**  
- **Proline**  

The target variable indicates the winemaker.

<h2>Problem and Approach</h2>

This project is a **classification problem** where the objective is to assign each wine sample to one of the three winemakers based on its chemical properties. 
With this analysis, I aim to build a model that achieves high accuracy in classifying the wines, potentially offering insights into the distinguishing chemical characteristics of each winemaker's products.
